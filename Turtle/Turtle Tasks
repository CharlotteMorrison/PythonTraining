Task 1: create a square with the turtle

Task 2: use goto(x,y) to create multiple squares
        notice how the code is repetitive in the previous task,
        how could it be more efficient?

Task 3: change the color of the squares using pencolor('red')
        more advanced: rgb values, pencolor(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
        color inputs are float numbers between 0.0 and 1.0

Task 4: create a square and a circle use penup() and pendown() to move your turtle without drawing a line.
        fill each shape with a different color.
        use: fillcolor(), sets the color for the fill
             begin_fill(), starts recording the moves that will be the outline of the filled-in shape
             end_fill() function will stop recording the moves for the filled-in shape and draw the shape

Task 5: use the turtle program to draw an image
        suggetions: olympic rings, spirograph, cartoon
